# Komodo (KMD) RPC client
A RPC client for [Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com) (KMD), made in Rust.

This is a work in progress!  

With credits to the coblox team's [Rust BTC RPC client](https://github.com/coblox/bitcoinrpc-rust-client).

This wrapper aims to:
- be stateless. It's up to the app using this library to maintain state.
